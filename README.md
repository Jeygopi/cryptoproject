## Thoughts about Consensus Algorithms 

**Proof of Work** consensus algorithms currently have a larger social issue pertaining to their environmental impact. Many users in the community see this consensus algorithm as unsustainable due to the immense amount of computing power needed to verify transactions. 

**Proof of Stake** is an alternative consensus mechanism that involves users "staking" their tokens in order to verify the integrity of the blockchain. Proof of Stake also has several issues however; the fact that many of the tokens are illiquid results in easily performed "rug pulls", where a large amount of liquidity owned by a particular group is sold, reducing the value of tokens significantly. In addition to this, the concept of staking is flawed and creates an economic system that models the real world, which challenges the original goal of several crypto projects.

An alternative consensus mechanism that combines the best aspects of both of the above consensus mechanisms would be ideal, as they both have their strengths, and the weaknesses have been well explored by now.
